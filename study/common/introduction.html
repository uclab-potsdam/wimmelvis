      <p>How many times do we throw something in the bin hoping it will be recycled even if we are definitely not sure about it?</p>

      <p>According to <span class="colored-text">environmental scientists</span>, wishcycling consists in putting something in the recycling bin and hoping it will be recycled, even if there is little evidence to confirm this assumption. And it’s a fairly widespread behavior with harmful consequences.</p>
      <p>To help you stop, we prepared the <span style="font-weight: 600;">ultimate Wishcycling guide for Berlin.</span></p>

    <h2>How does recycling impact the environment?</h2>
    <div class= "sidenote-container" style="margin-bottom: 12em;">
      <div class="continuous-text">
        <p>Recycling is the process of converting waste into new materials and objects. Recycling waste has various environmental benefits, such as preventing pollution or conserving natural resources. Its importance has been increasing over all Western countries, especially since the 70s as a way to save energy.</p>
        <p><span class="colored-text">Municipal waste</span> in particular – which covers every type of waste collected within municipalities, from office supplies to market cleansing waste, including the one generated in our households – is a great source of secondary and raw materials and needs to be carefully sorted, handled and disposed of.</p>
        <p>Within the EU, most of the countries have significantly increased their municipal waste recycling rates since 2004. The trend varies greatly, starting from Montenegro recycling only 5% of their municipal waste and ending with Germany, where up to 67% of the waste is recycled.</p>

        <p>Despite this positive trend, the
          <span style="font-weight: 600;">
            overall volume of waste generated per inhabitant is currently increasing
          </span>.
          In 2020, 9 kilograms extra of waste per person has been generated, going from 469
          to 478 kilograms. In Berlin alone, <span style="font-weight: 600;">242 kg</span> of
          waste was produced per household. If properly paired with structural change and
          considerate policymaking, recycling is an essential strategy to deal with the increasing
          amount of waste generated.

    <h2>Why is Wishcycling so dangerous?</h2>
    <div class="sidenote-container">
      <div class="continuous-text">
        <p>More importantly: knowing how certain types of waste need to be disposed of and how
           to correctly place them in the garbage is key for successful recycling strategies as
           well as for understanding
           <span class="colored-text">how waste is taken care of after us</span>.</p>
        <p>First, by misplacing waste the risk is to contaminate the waste stream with
           non-recyclable material and the process gets more complicated and costly, requiring
           extra labor and <span class="colored-text">damaging sorting systems</span>. Lack of awareness on how certain waste should
           be treated also jeopardizes our ability to ask for change at a broader level and to be
           aware of which policies and regulations should be enforced.

      <div class="sidenote">
        <p>In Germany a lot has been done since the beginning of this century to improve waste
           management policies. For instance, regulations on landfills have been largely updated
           to better organize the monitoring and treatment of waste. However,
           according to NABU, still a large quantity of household waste is
           <span style="font-weight: 600;">incinerated rather than recycled</span>. This is due to costs, for
           municipalities it is still more convenient to burn waste rather than
           properly recycle it.
