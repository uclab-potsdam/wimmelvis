# Building

As we reuse quite a lot of HTML for the A/B versions, a basic templating engine is used. That requires unfortunately, that in order to use the page you have to **build** the page everytime you change something.

Before building you have to install the necessary dependencies once:

```
npm install
```

Building then works by running

```
npm run build
```
